Data Science Specialization John's Hopkins University / Coursera

Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

The Getting & Cleaning Data course finishes up with an assignment. The challenge is uploading an R-script that will produce a dataset out of a source dataset. The assignment points to a weblocation where the dataset can be downloaded from. When the file is downloaded it must be unzipped first before the contents can be used inside R. Via a number of steps / commands the script will produce another tidy dataset that has been uploaded to Coursera.

Private Project; Uses a Sound Workflow

The project has been devided over several seperate R-files:

Load.R contains the necessary steps involved in getting the data, Clean.R stores the code that cleans and tidies the data, Function.R has a collection of functions that are used for cleaning and / or analysing the data, Do.R is the file with the steps / commands used for analysing the dataset and production of graphs and / or a report.
