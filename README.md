## Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

The Getting & Cleaning Data course finishes up with an assignment. The challenge is uploading an R-script that will produce a dataset out of a source dataset. The assignment points to a weblocation where the dataset can be downloaded from. When the file is downloaded it must be unzipped first before the contents can be used inside R. Via a number of steps / commands the script will produce another tidy dataset that has been uploaded to Coursera.

# Analyses of Eredivisie Football Seasons 1993/1994 - 2014/2015

## Private Project; Uses a Sound Workflow

The project has been devided over several seperate R-files: Load.R contains the necessary steps involved in getting the data, Clean.R stores the code that cleans and tidies the data, Function.R has a collection of functions that are used for cleaning and / or analysing the data, Do.R is the file with the steps / commands used for analysing the dataset and production of graphs and / or a report.

# Risc Analyses of Court Case (Dutch!)

## Private Project; Uses R for Visualization

The foundation of the building we live in has to be renewed because of a renovation project at a neighboring address. We've claimed the damage that was inflicted upon our building from the party responsible for the renovation, but they have not accepted liability. Therefore we (the association of owners) were left with the choice between abandonning our claim or taking the guilty party to court. Lawyers are expensive and the outcome of such a case is always unsure, so we needed to get a grip on the expected monetary value of a potential court case. I used R to visualize a number of scenario's and calculated some break-even points. On the basis of this analyses the association of owners decided to go ahead with the case, which is now pending at the court of Amsterdam.
